							During my M.Sc., I worked on "The Halo Model Of The Large Scale Structures Of The Universe" under the 
							supervision of <a href="https://visvabharati.irins.org/profile/151672">Dr. Biswajit Pandey</a>. 
							In this project, I reviewed the Halo Model that divides all the masses of the Universe into distinct 
							chunks called Halos. I learned about large-scale structure formations and various approximations used
							 to explain their formations. I calculated the probability of Halos lying between specific mass ranges
							  using the NFW (Navarro-Frenk-White) profile.

						In the early stage of my Ph.D., my research focused on computing the aligned-spin 
						effects in spherical harmonic mode amplitudes of the gravitational waveform for eccentric 
						inspirals using post-Newtonian multipolar post-Minkowskian (PN-MPM) formalism.</p>

						
 <p>It is well known that compact binaries tend to circularize when they enter the ground-based detector frequency 
	band. However, binaries formed via dynamical interactions in dense stellar clusters or through Kozai-Lidov processes 
  can have large residual eccentricities.  Besides, orbital eccentricity is the cleanest feature to know about 
  binary formation channels.
The effect of the orbital eccentricity and spins of binary constituents are substantial on the gravitational 
waveform; neglecting it results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while detecting a likely spinning eccentric
 candidate. Though the effect of eccentricity are explored separately, a combined treatment including spins and 
 eccentricity is largely absent. Hence, it's very important to compute these effects on the gravitational waveform 
 to understand the spinning eccentric inspirals.</p>

<p>The computation of spin effects in spherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waveform for eccentric inspirals 
involves source multipole moments and equations of motion of the system. The source multipole moments characterize 
the system properties and are functions of relative separation, relative velocity, and spins of 
the binary constituents. Taking source multipole moments and equations of motion as inputs, we compute spin 
effects in spherical harmonic modes valid for generic orbits within PN-MPM formalism. Next, we use generalized 
quasi-Keplerian representation to specialize these modes to elliptical 
orbits. This work is now published and can be found in arXiv:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04155">2211.04155</a>.
</p>

<p>Next, my focus was to use the analytical expressions derived in arXiv:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04155">2211.04155</a> and build a 
ready-to-use waveform model that includes effects due to spin, eccentricity and high-order modes for 
the detection of eccentric binary black hole mergers (BBHs).
The waveform models like SpinTaylorT4, IMRPhenomXHM, IMRPhenomXPHM and 
SEOBNRv4, SEOBNRv4HM, SEOBNRv5 include the spin effects and EccentricTD, 
EccentricFD, TaylorF2Ecc (with quasi-circular spins) include eccentricity effects separately; 
however, a full IMR reviewed waveform model that incorporates all these effects simultaneously, is absent. 
We present ESIGMAHM: a time-domain, spinning eccentric IMR waveform model with higher-order modes for 
the detection and characterization of eccentric BBH mergers in arXiv:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13866v1">2409.13866</a>.
</p>

<p>I'm also involved in another project where we compute the spinning eccentric corrections in GW phase up to 
3PN order in small eccentricity limit. We obtain these corrections in various Taylor approximants: 
TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4, and TaylorF2.
 We have imeplemented the eccentricity expanded up to 2nd order in eccentricity spinning corrections in TaylorF2
  phase in <a href="https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/lalsuite/lalsuite/index.html">LALSuite</a> with the approximant name SpinTaylorF2Ecc. </p>
